## General Information
My main goal in creating the project is to learn how to create
business logic and understand how similar applications work underneath.
I chose this type of project because of its complexity and potential for
future expansion, which will also be followed by my own development as a developer.
Right from the start, I encountered many problems and challenges, from the choice of technology
and interface design to the actual coding of the various functionalities. Despite the obstacles,
Creating this project helped me a lot to grow in areas such as Databases, Backend, Frontend, and even UI/UX.
